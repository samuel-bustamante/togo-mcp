Your task is to thoroughly explore available databases in TogoMCP to prepare for question generation. Do NOT create any questions yet - this is purely an exploration phase.

⚠️ **TOKEN MANAGEMENT**: If you approach your token limit (around 150,000+ tokens used), STOP immediately. Do NOT rush through remaining databases with "concise" or "efficient" exploration. Quality over quantity. Save remaining databases for the next session.

SETUP:
1. First, check which databases have already been explored:
   - Look for existing exploration reports in `/Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/exploration/`
   - If reports exist, note which databases are DONE and skip them

2. Read these files to understand the context:
   * /Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/QUESTION_DESIGN_GUIDE.md
   * /Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/scripts/QUESTION_FORMAT.md
   * /Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/scripts/example_questions.json

3. Run list_databases() to see all available databases.

4. Identify which databases still need exploration (databases without exploration reports).

EXPLORATION TASK:
For EACH database that needs exploration:

1. **Read the MIE file**: Call get_MIE_file(dbname)

2. **Study the structure**:
   - Carefully read the ShEx schema to understand properties and relationships
   - Review the RDF examples to see data patterns
   - Study ALL SPARQL query examples

3. **Explore the content**:
   - Run at least 5 different search queries using search_* functions
   - Test at least 3 SPARQL queries from the MIE file examples
   - Try variations to understand what data is available
   - Look for interesting, specific entities
   - **CRITICAL: When exploring cross-references/mappings, distinguish between:**
     * **Entity count**: Number of unique entities that have mappings
     * **Relationship count**: Total number of mapping relationships
     * Example: If 100 proteins map to 120 gene IDs (some proteins map to multiple genes), then:
       - Entity count = 100 proteins with mappings
       - Relationship count = 120 total protein→gene mappings

4. **Document findings**: Create an exploration report at:
   `/Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/exploration/[dbname]_exploration.md`
   
   Each report MUST include:
````markdown
   # [Database Name] Exploration Report
   
   ## Database Overview
   - Purpose and scope of this database
   - Key data types and entities
   
   ## Schema Analysis (from MIE file)
   - Main properties available
   - Important relationships
   - Query patterns observed
   
   ## Search Queries Performed
   1. Query: [search term] → Results: [summary]
   2. Query: [search term] → Results: [summary]
   3. [etc., at least 5 queries]
   
   ## SPARQL Queries Tested
```sparql
   # Query 1: [purpose]
   [SPARQL query]
   # Results: [summary of what you found]
```
```sparql
   # Query 2: [purpose]
   [SPARQL query]
   # Results: [summary]
```
   
   [At least 3 queries total]
   
   ## Interesting Findings
   - Specific entities that could form good questions
   - Unique properties or patterns
   - Connections to other databases
   - Specific, verifiable facts not commonly known
   
   **⚠️ CRITICAL: Cross-Reference/Mapping Analysis**
   
   When documenting cross-database mappings, ALWAYS clarify:
   
   1. **Entity Count** (unique entities with mappings):
      - Query: `COUNT(DISTINCT ?source_entity)`
      - Example: "2,150 NANDO diseases have MONDO mappings"
   
   2. **Relationship Count** (total mapping relationships):
      - Query: `COUNT(?mapping_property)` (without DISTINCT)
      - Example: "2,341 total NANDO→MONDO mapping relationships"
   
   3. **Mapping Distribution** (if entities can have multiple mappings):
      - How many entities map to exactly 1, 2, 3+ targets?
      - Example: "1,976 diseases (1 MONDO ID), 157 diseases (2 MONDO IDs), 17 diseases (3 MONDO IDs)"
   
   4. **Average Mappings** (if relevant):
      - Total relationships ÷ Entity count
      - Example: "Average 1.09 MONDO mappings per NANDO disease"
   
   **Why This Matters:**
   - Questions like "How many diseases have MONDO mappings?" = Entity count (2,150)
   - Questions like "How many MONDO mappings exist?" = Relationship count (2,341)
   - Both are valid but measure different things!
   - Document BOTH counts to enable precise question generation
   
   **Example SPARQL Queries for Mapping Analysis:**
   
```sparql
   # Count unique entities WITH mappings
   SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?entity) as ?entity_count)
   WHERE {
     ?entity <mapping_property> ?target .
   }
   
   # Count total mapping relationships
   SELECT (COUNT(?target) as ?relationship_count)
   WHERE {
     ?entity <mapping_property> ?target .
   }
   
   # Analyze mapping distribution
   SELECT ?mapping_count (COUNT(?entity) as ?entity_count)
   WHERE {
     {
       SELECT ?entity (COUNT(?target) as ?mapping_count)
       WHERE {
         ?entity <mapping_property> ?target .
       }
       GROUP BY ?entity
     }
   }
   GROUP BY ?mapping_count
   ORDER BY ?mapping_count
```
   
   ## Question Opportunities by Category
   
   **FOCUS ON BIOLOGICAL CONTENT, NOT INFRASTRUCTURE METADATA**
   
   When identifying question opportunities, prioritize:
   ✅ Biological entities (proteins, genes, diseases, compounds)
   ✅ Scientific properties (molecular weight, sequences, pathways)
   ✅ Research-relevant metadata (clinical significance, resistance patterns)
   ✅ Experimental methodology when it affects interpretation (AST methods, resolution)
   
   AVOID suggesting questions about:
   ❌ Database versions or release numbers
   ❌ Software tools used (unless methodology-critical)
   ❌ Pure IT infrastructure (server details, update schedules)
   ❌ Administrative metadata with no scientific value
   
   For each category, suggest questions about BIOLOGICAL/SCIENTIFIC CONTENT:
   
   - **Precision**: Specific biological IDs, measurements, sequences
     Example: "What is the UniProt ID for SpCas9?" ✅
     Avoid: "What version is the database?" ❌
   
   - **Completeness**: Counts of biological entities, comprehensive lists
     Example: "How many kinase structures in PDB?" ✅
     Example: "How many proteins have GO annotations?" ✅
     **⚠️ For cross-references, specify WHICH count:**
       - "How many proteins HAVE GO annotations?" (entity count) ✅
       - "How many total protein→GO annotation relationships?" (relationship count) ✅
     Avoid: "How many database updates this year?" ❌
   
   - **Integration**: Cross-database biological entity linking
     Example: "Convert UniProt ID to NCBI Gene ID" ✅
     Example: "What MONDO IDs map to NANDO:1200001?" ✅
     **⚠️ Be aware of one-to-many mappings:**
       - Some entities may map to multiple targets
       - Document both directions if mappings are asymmetric
     Avoid: "Which databases link to this server?" ❌
   
   - **Currency**: Recent biological discoveries, updated classifications
     Example: "What COVID-19 pathways added to Reactome?" ✅
     Avoid: "What is the current database version?" ❌
   
   - **Specificity**: Rare diseases, specialized organisms, niche compounds
     Example: "What is the NANDO ID for rare disease X?" ✅
     Avoid: "What is the most common database format?" ❌
   
   - **Structured Query**: Complex biological queries with multiple criteria
     Example: "Find kinase inhibitors with IC50 < 100 nM" ✅
     Example: "Find diseases that map to exactly 2 MONDO IDs" ✅
     Avoid: "Find databases updated after date X" ❌

5. **Monitor your progress**: After completing each database exploration, check your token usage. If approaching limits, proceed to the STOPPING POINT section below.

WORKFLOW:
1. Check for existing exploration reports and identify remaining databases
2. Read the three required files (if first session)
3. List all databases
4. Create the exploration directory (if it doesn't exist):
   `/Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/exploration/`
5. For each database that needs exploration:
   - Get MIE file
   - Perform thorough exploration (searches, queries, analysis)
   - **For databases with cross-references: Run queries to distinguish entity counts from relationship counts**
   - Create detailed exploration report
   - **Check token usage** - if approaching limit, go to STOPPING POINT
6. If ALL databases are explored, proceed to COMPLETION section

STOPPING POINT (When Token Limit is Approaching):
Create a progress file: `/Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/exploration/00_PROGRESS.md`
````markdown
# Exploration Progress

## Session [N] - [Date]

### Completed Databases ([X] of [Total])
- [database1] ✅
- [database2] ✅
- [etc.]

### Remaining Databases ([Y] remaining)
- [database_a] ⏳
- [database_b] ⏳
- [etc.]

### Notes
- [Any observations about the databases explored so far]
- [Any patterns or challenges noticed]
````

Then respond with:

"⏸️ EXPLORATION PAUSED - TOKEN LIMIT APPROACHING

Explored [X] of [Y] databases in this session:
✅ Completed: [list]
⏳ Remaining: [list]

All exploration reports saved to /Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/exploration/

To continue: Run this prompt again. It will automatically skip completed databases and continue with remaining ones.

DO NOT proceed to question generation until ALL databases are explored."

COMPLETION (When ALL Databases Are Explored):
Create a summary file: `/Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/evaluation/exploration/00_SUMMARY.md`
````markdown

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- **NEVER sacrifice exploration quality for speed**
- **STOP when token limit approaches** - don't rush
- **Each database deserves thorough exploration**
- **Existing exploration reports will be preserved** across sessions
- **The prompt will automatically resume** where you left off
- **Focus on biological/scientific content** - avoid pure infrastructure metadata
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Distinguish entity counts from relationship counts in cross-reference mappings**

Begin by checking for existing exploration reports, then proceed with thorough exploration of remaining databases.
