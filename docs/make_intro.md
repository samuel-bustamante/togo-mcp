# Create an introductory HTML page for TogoMCP
TogoMCP is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides LLM agents with access to a vast ecosystem of life sciences databases through SPARQL queries, RDF data exploration, and ID conversion services. It integrates over 20 major biological and biomedical databases, offering researchers a powerful toolkit for cross-database queries, data integration, and knowledge discovery.

The TogoMCP endpoint is available at https://togomcp.rdfportal.org/mcp.
It is developed by DBCLS.

## Goal
Create an HTML page for researchers in biology and medicine who are not necessarily familiar with bioinformatics, explaining what TogoMCP is and how it can help their research. It should contain the following.
- Summary of TogoMCP
- Usage examples
- Setup guide
- List of available databases
- List of available tools
- Other MCP Servers
- Related Resources

## Style
- Use https://togomcp.rdfportal.org/ as a template.
- Follow the style of DBCLS's default CSS at https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/style/default.css.
- However, make it readable both on PC and smartphone.
- Put the DBCLS Logo with the link at the page top.
- Mind the contrast! 
- The hero section should show the MCP endpoint URL.

## Study TogoMCP
Explore the TogoMCP tools to study how they work and the available databases.

## Usage examples
Read the following files that contain example conversations. 
Give the prompt of each session, followed by a summary of the response.
Include the description of the TogoMCP tools used.

- /Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/docs/example1.md
- /Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/docs/example2.md
- /Users/arkinjo/work/GitHub/togo-mcp/docs/example3.md

Each example should be presented in the following form:
```
Example 1.
Prompt: (The prompt provided by the user)
Response: 
(The summary of the process of finding the results)
Tools Used: 
(the list of TogoMCP tools used along the way)
Key Results:
(The summary of findings)
```

## Setup guide
Read the following webpages carefully and write a concise, accurate setup guide for each.
- [Claude Desktop](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11175166-getting-started-with-custom-connectors-using-remote-mcp#h_3d1a65aded)
  * Method 1 (for paid plans). Settings -> Connectors -> "Add custom connectors"
  * Method 2. (alternative). Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config (JSON config file)
- [ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/ja-jp/articles/12584461-developer-mode-apps-and-full-mcp-connectors-in-chatgpt-beta) (Paid plans only)
- [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/#how-to-set-up-your-mcp-server) Note that TogoMCP is provided via **Streamable-HTTP, not SSE**.
For Gemini CLI, the settings.json should be 
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "togomcp": {
      "httpUrl": "https://togomcp.rdfportal.org/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

    <div class='footer__organism-text'>
        <p class="footer__organism-main">Database Center for Life Science</p>
        <p class="footer__organism-sub">Joint Support-Center for Data Science Research</p>
        <p class="footer__organism-sub">Research Organization of Information and Systems</p>
    </div>
```
- Also add the link to each item.
- Make sure all the links are alive and correct.

**IMPORTANT!**
- Make sure to follow the style of DBCLS's default CSS at https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/style/default.css in the footer.
