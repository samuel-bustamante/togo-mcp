    "question": "Which antibiotics are likely effective against Enterococcus faecalis that is resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin but remains susceptible to gentamicin?",
    "expected_answer": "Doxycycline and linezolid.",
    "notes": "(By Oikawa) Database: BacDive. Tests complex filtering with multiple antibiotic susceptibility criteria: (1) organism = Enterococcus faecalis, (2) resistant to ampicillin, (3) resistant to vancomycin, (4) susceptible to gentamicin, (5) identify other effective antibiotics. Requires structured database query to filter strain-specific antimicrobial susceptibility data. Baseline cannot perform such specific susceptibility pattern filtering. This represents a realistic clinical microbiology question for antibiotic selection."

    "question": "Is Helicobacter pylori that is resistant to clarithromycin and levofloxacin likely to remain susceptible to tetracycline?",
    "expected_answer": "Yes",
    "notes": "(By Oikawa) Database: BacDive. Tests querying antibiotic resistance patterns with multiple constraints: (1) organism = Helicobacter pylori, (2) resistant to clarithromycin, (3) resistant to levofloxacin, (4) check tetracycline susceptibility. Requires structured search and filtering of antimicrobial susceptibility data across different resistance patterns. Baseline knowledge may have general information about H. pylori resistance but cannot query specific strain-level susceptibility patterns from database. This is a clinically relevant question for treatment planning in multi-drug resistant H. pylori infections."
