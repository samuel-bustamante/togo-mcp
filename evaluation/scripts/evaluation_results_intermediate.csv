**Key mTOR-related pathways include:**

1. **mTOR signaling pathway** - The central pathway where mTOR functions as a serine/threonine kinase in two main complexes:
   - mTORC1 (mTOR Complex 1)
   - mTORC2 (mTOR Complex 2)

2. **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway** - A major growth and survival signaling cascade

3. **Autophagy regulation** - mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy initiation

4. **Protein synthesis/translation control** - mTOR regulates ribosomal biogenesis and translation initiation

5. **Amino acid sensing pathways** - mTOR responds to amino acid availability

6. **Energy metabolism regulation** - Including glucose and lipid metabolism

7. **Cell cycle regulation** - mTOR influences G1/S transition

8. **Growth factor signaling** - Downstream of insulin, IGF-1, and other growth factors

For the most current and comprehensive list of mTOR-involved pathways in Reactome, I'd recommend directly searching the Reactome database (reactome.org) for ""mTOR"" or ""MTOR"" to get the exact pathway annotations and identifiers they use.",,7.848107814788818,55,353,True,True,1.0,"Based on my search of the Reactome database, here are the key biochemical pathways that involve the mTOR protein:

## Primary mTOR-Related Pathways:

### 1. **MTOR Signalling** (Main pathway)
This is the central pathway directly involving mTOR protein, found across multiple species in the database. The pathway has two main sub-components:

- **mTORC1-mediated signalling** - This involves mTOR Complex 1, which is the primary nutrient and growth factor sensing complex
- **Energy dependent regulation of mTOR by LKB1-AMPK** - This involves the regulation of mTOR activity by the cellular energy sensor AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)

### 2. **Autophagy**
mTOR is a key negative regulator of autophagy. The database contains extensive autophagy pathways where mTOR plays a crucial inhibitory role:
- General autophagy pathways
- Selective autophagy pathways

### 3. **Insulin and Growth Factor Signaling**
Several insulin-related pathways are closely connected to mTOR signaling:
- **Signaling by Insulin receptor**
- **Insulin receptor signalling cascade**
- **Signaling by Type 1 Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R)**
- **Growth hormone receptor signaling**

### 4. **Cellular Growth and Proliferation**
mTOR is involved in pathways regulating:
- **Axonal growth stimulation**
- **Axonal growth inhibition (RHOA activation)**

## Key Biochemical Reactions:

The database shows specific reactions involving mTOR, including:
- **Formation of Ragulator complex** - This is a key reaction where mTOR interacts with the Ragulator complex for lysosomal amino acid sensing

## Functional Context:

mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) serves as a central hub integrating signals from:
- **Nutrients** (especially amino acids)
- **Growth factors** (insulin, IGF-1)
- **Energy status** (via AMPK)
- **Oxygen levels**

The protein coordinates cellular responses including:
- Protein synthesis regulation
- Autophagy control
- Cell growth and proliferation
- Metabolic homeostasis

1. **GO:0006914 - autophagy**
   - Definition: ""The cellular catabolic process in which cells digest cellular materials, such as organelles and other macromolecular constituents, or non-self materials such as intracellular pathogens. Autophagy serves to provide essential nutrients under conditions of cellular stress; or can remodel intracellular structures during cell differentiation.""

The GO hierarchy shows that macroautophagy (GO:0016236) has ""autophagy"" (GO:0006914) as its direct parent term. Macroautophagy is defined as ""The autophagic process that proceeds via the formation of an autophagosome,"" making it a specific type of autophagy.

Note that autophagy (GO:0006914) itself has two direct parent terms:
- **GO:0009056 - catabolic process** 
- **GO:0061919 - process utilizing autophagic mechanism**

This reflects the dual nature of autophagy as both a catabolic (breakdown) process and a process that utilizes autophagic mechanisms for cellular maintenance and regulation.",,24.76243305206299,"mcp__ols__search, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__ols__getAncestors","[{""name"": ""mcp__ols__search"", ""input"": {""query"": ""macroautophagy GO:0016236""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__ols__fetch"", ""input"": {""id"": ""go+http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0016236""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__ols__getAncestors"", ""input"": {""ontologyId"": ""go"", ""classIri"": ""http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0016236""}}]",CRITICAL,GO:0006914 (autophagy),Tests ability to navigate ontology relationships using structured queries.
