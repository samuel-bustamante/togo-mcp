7,2025-12-18,Currency,What biochemical pathways in the Reactome database involve the mTOR protein?,True,False,True,0.6666666666666666,"Based on my knowledge of biochemical pathways and mTOR signaling, the mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) protein is involved in several key pathways that would likely be represented in the Reactome database:

**Primary mTOR-related pathways include:**

1. **mTOR signaling pathway** - The core pathway involving mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes
2. **PI3K/AKT signaling pathway** - mTOR is a key downstream effector of AKT
3. **Insulin signaling pathway** - mTOR mediates many metabolic effects of insulin
4. **Growth factor signaling** - Various growth factors activate mTOR
5. **Amino acid sensing and signaling** - mTOR responds to amino acid availability
6. **Autophagy regulation** - mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy
7. **Protein synthesis/translation initiation** - mTOR regulates ribosome biogenesis and translation
8. **Lipid metabolism** - mTOR influences lipogenesis
9. **Glucose metabolism** - mTOR affects glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
10. **Cell cycle regulation** - mTOR influences cell growth and proliferation

However, I should note that I don't have direct access to the current Reactome database to provide the exact pathway names, identifiers, or current organizational structure. The specific way these pathways are categorized and named in Reactome may differ from my general description. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about mTOR pathways in Reactome, I'd recommend checking the database directly.",,7.991970062255859,55,379,True,True,0.8888888888888888,"Based on my analysis of the Reactome database, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the biochemical pathways involving the mTOR protein:

## Major mTOR-Related Pathways in Reactome

### 1. **Core mTOR Signaling Pathway**
- **MTOR signalling** - This is the main umbrella pathway for all mTOR-related processes

### 2. **mTORC1-mediated signalling**
This is one of the most important mTOR pathways, representing the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling cascade. mTORC1 is a key regulator of:
- Protein synthesis
- Cell growth and proliferation
- Metabolic processes
- Ribosome biogenesis

### 3. **Energy-dependent regulation of mTOR by LKB1-AMPK**
This pathway represents the energy-sensing mechanism that regulates mTOR activity:
- **LKB1** (liver kinase B1) activates **AMPK** (AMP-activated protein kinase)
- AMPK acts as a cellular energy sensor
- When energy levels are low, AMPK inhibits mTOR to conserve energy and promote catabolic processes

### 4. **Amino acids regulate mTORC1**
This pathway shows how amino acid availability regulates mTORC1 activity:
- Amino acids (particularly leucine, arginine, and glutamine) activate mTORC1
- This regulation occurs through the Rag GTPases and Ragulator complex
- Essential for nutrient sensing and metabolic adaptation

## Related Pathways Connected to mTOR Signaling

### 5. **PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathways**
Multiple pathways in this category connect to mTOR:
- **PI3K/AKT activation**
- **PI3K Cascade**
- **PKB-mediated events** (PKB is another name for AKT)
- **Activation of PKB**

The PI3K/AKT pathway is upstream of mTOR and activates mTORC1 through:
- Growth factor signaling → PI3K → AKT → TSC1/2 inhibition → mTORC1 activation

### 6. **Insulin and Growth Factor Signaling**
- **Signaling by Insulin receptor**
- **Signaling by Type 1 Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R)**

These pathways activate mTOR through the PI3K/AKT cascade in response to growth signals and nutrient availability.

### 7. **Autophagy**
- **Autophagy** pathways are negatively regulated by mTORC1
- When mTORC1 is active (nutrients abundant), autophagy is suppressed
- When mTORC1 is inactive (nutrients scarce), autophagy is promoted for cellular recycling

## Biological Significance

The mTOR protein serves as a central hub integrating multiple cellular signals:

1. **Nutrient availability** (amino acids, glucose)
2. **Growth factors** (insulin, IGF-1)
3. **Energy status** (ATP/AMP ratio via AMPK)
4. **Oxygen levels** and stress conditions

mTOR coordinates these inputs to control:
- **Anabolic processes** (protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, nucleotide synthesis)
- **Catabolic processes** (autophagy regulation)
- **Cell growth and proliferation**
- **Metabolic homeostasis**

These pathways are crucial for understanding cellular metabolism, cancer biology, aging, and metabolic diseases, making mTOR a significant target for therapeutic interventions.",,73.5804831981659,47,3200,13187,233351,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathway ?pathwayName ?reaction ?reactionName\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  #
