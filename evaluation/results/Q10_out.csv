## About blaNDM-1:

**blaNDM-1** (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) is an antibiotic resistance gene that encodes a carbapenemase enzyme. Key characteristics include:

1. **Resistance Profile**: It confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics, which are considered last-resort drugs for treating serious bacterial infections. It also provides resistance to most other beta-lactam antibiotics except aztreonam.

2. **Mechanism**: It's a metallo-beta-lactamase (Class B beta-lactamase) that requires zinc ions for its catalytic activity and hydrolyzes carbapenem antibiotics.

3. **Mobile Genetic Element**: The gene is typically carried on plasmids, making it easily transferable between different bacterial species through horizontal gene transfer.

4. **Clinical Significance**: NDM-1 is considered a major public health threat because infections caused by NDM-1-producing bacteria are very difficult to treat.

5. **Geographic Distribution**: First identified in 2008 in a patient from New Delhi, India, it has since spread globally.

## Regarding AMR Portal Data:

I cannot access the AMR Portal database or any real-time databases, so I cannot tell you how many isolates currently carry blaNDM-1 in their system. You would need to visit the AMR Portal directly to get current statistics on isolate counts.",,9.206151962280273,61,356,True,True,0.8333333333333334,"Based on the information I've gathered from PubMed and other sources, let me provide you with comprehensive information about blaNDM-1:

## What is the blaNDM-1 gene?

**blaNDM-1** (New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase-1) is a gene that encodes a carbapenemase enzyme - a type of β-lactamase that can break down carbapenem antibiotics, which are often considered ""last-resort"" antibiotics for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Type**: Metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) - requires metal ions (typically zinc) for its activity
2. **Resistance Profile**: Confers resistance to nearly all β-lactam antibiotics including:
   - Carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem)
   - Cephalosporins
   - Penicillins
   - Does NOT hydrolyze aztreonam (a monobactam)

3. **Genetic Mobility**: The gene is typically:
   - Located on plasmids (mobile genetic elements)
   - Associated with transposons (Tn125, Tn3)
   - Can spread between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer
   - Found on various plasmid types (IncA/C, IncF, IncX3, etc.)

4. **Clinical Significance**: According to PubMed research:
   - Found in high-risk bacterial clones (e.g., *Klebsiella pneumoniae* ST307, ST258, ST147)
   - Often co-occurs with other resistance genes (blaOXA-23, blaVIM)
   - Contributes to multidrug resistance patterns
   - Associated with nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections

5. **Geographic Distribution**: Originally identified in New Delhi, India (2008), but now found worldwide

## AMR Portal Data

Unfortunately, I encountered technical difficulties querying the AMR Portal SPARQL endpoint directly to get the exact count of isolates carrying blaNDM-1. The AMR Portal database contains:
- **1.7 million** phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility test results
- **1.1 million** genotypic AMR features from bacterial isolates worldwide
- Data from ~1.4 million unique BioSamples

The database structure indicates that blaNDM-1 would be recorded as part of the **GenotypeFeature** entities with the field `amr:amrElementSymbol` or `amr:geneSymbol`. The database integrates data from NCBI Pathogen Detection, PATRIC, and CABBAGE sources.

### Recent Research Findings (According to PubMed):

A recent 2026 study in Ecuador ([DOI: 10.1093/jambio/lxag008](https://doi.org/10.1093/jambio/lxag008)) found that blaNDM-1 was one of the predominant carbapenemase genes (along with blaKPC-2 and blaOXA-181) in bloodstream infections.

Another 2026 study in Nepal ([DOI: 10.1186/s12866-025-04692-z](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-025-04692-z)) detected blaNDM-1 in **66.7%** of *Acinetobacter baumannii* isolates from cardiac patients, with co-occurrence patterns showing the gene's widespread distribution.

## Major Disease Categories in NANDO (Direct Children of Root)

The NANDO ontology has a hierarchical structure with **NANDO:1000001** serving as the main parent class under the root intractable disease concept (NANDO:0000001). 

The documentation shows at least these major disease categories that are direct children of NANDO:1000001:

   - Japanese: 神経・筋疾患
   - Mapped to MONDO:0019056

2. **Metabolic disease** (NANDO:1100002)
   - Japanese: 代謝系疾患
   - Mapped to MONDO:0004955 and MONDO:0005066

The documentation indicates that:
- **Disease categories use NANDO:11xxxxx IDs**
- **Specific diseases use NANDO:12xxxxx IDs**
- The hierarchy follows: owl:Thing → Intractable disease (NANDO:0000001) → Designated intractable disease (NANDO:1000001) → Disease categories (NANDO:11xxxxx) → Specific diseases (NANDO:12xxxxx)

According to the statistical data in the documentation, NANDO contains **2,777 total diseases** organized hierarchically, with the major categories at the 1100000-level serving as the primary organizational structure for classifying Japanese intractable (rare) diseases.
