13,2026-01-13,Precision,What is the highest resolution ever achieved for a protein structure in the PDB?,True,True,True,1.0,"Based on my training knowledge, the highest resolution protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have achieved resolutions better than 0.50 Å (angstroms).

Some of the highest resolution structures I'm aware of include:

- **Crambin** - which has been refined to resolutions around **0.48 Å** and even **0.54 Å** in various depositions
- Several small proteins and peptides have achieved sub-0.60 Å resolution

These ultra-high resolution structures are typically achieved with:
- Very small, highly stable proteins
- Exceptionally well-diffracting crystals
- Synchrotron radiation sources
- Cryo-crystallography techniques

At these resolutions, individual hydrogen atoms can sometimes be directly observed in the electron density maps, and the positions of atoms can be determined with exceptional precision.

However, I should note that the exact record-holder may have changed since my training data, as new structures are continuously being deposited to the PDB. The sub-0.50 Å range represents the current frontier for protein crystallography resolution.",,7.7045087814331055,53,247,True,False,0.0,"Based on my searches, I found several ultra-high resolution protein structures.

- **Total classes: 30,304**
- **Active diseases: 28,500**

The discrepancy is likely due to:
1. **Different versions**: OLS may have a more recent version than RDF Portal
2. **What's counted**: The OLS number (56,942) includes all classes in the ontology hierarchy, including imported upper-level ontology terms from BFO (Basic Formal Ontology) and other foundational ontologies

- **Active (non-deprecated) diseases**: ~28,500

### Key Findings:

- **Beta-lactam resistance genes** are by far the most prevalent, accounting for over 243,000 genotype features
- The top 3 classes (Beta-lactam, Aminoglycoside, and Efflux) together represent over 611,000 features - more than half of all AMR genotype features in the database
- Several entries represent **multi-drug resistance classes** (combinations like ""PHENICOL/QUINOLONE"" or ""BETA-LACTAM/MACROLIDE/TETRACYCLINE""), indicating genes that confer resistance to multiple antibiotic classes
- **Efflux pumps** (ranked 3rd) are a major mechanism of resistance, capable of expelling multiple drug types from bacterial cells
