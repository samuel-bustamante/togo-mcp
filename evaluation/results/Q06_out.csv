3. **NaCl (Sodium chloride): 10 g/L** - Provides essential ions and maintains osmotic balance

## Optional/Variant Components:

The MediaDive database shows that medium 381 includes several variations of LB medium with additional components:
- **Agar: 15-20 g/L** - For solid media preparation (LB agar plates)
- **Glucose: 2 g/L** - Occasionally added as a carbon source
- **Other salts** (in specific variants): MnSO₄, boric acid, hexadecane

## Summary:

The **standard LB liquid medium** contains just three basic components:
- **10 g/L Tryptone**
- **5 g/L Yeast extract**  
- **10 g/L NaCl**

For **LB agar plates**, 15-20 g/L of agar is added to solidify the medium. The database shows this is one of the most widely used bacterial culture media, with numerous variants adapted for specific applications (with different salt concentrations, antibiotics, or supplements).",,69.60594415664673,31,1478,12641,193217,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT ?medium ?label\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/mediadive>\nWHERE {\n  ?medium a schema:CultureMedium ;\n          rdfs:label ?label .\n  ?label bif:contains \""'LB'\""\n}\nLIMIT 20""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT ?medium ?mediumLabel ?ingredient ?ingredientLabel ?gPerL\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/mediadive>\nWHERE {\n  ?composition a schema:MediumComposition ;\n               schema:partOfMedium ?medium ;\n               schema:containsIngredient ?ingredient ;\n               schema:gramsPerLiter ?gPerL .\n  ?medium rdfs:label ?mediumLabel .\n  ?ingredient rdfs:label ?ingredientLabel .\n  FILTER(?medium = <https://purl.dsmz.de/mediadive/medium/381>)\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?gPerL)""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?ingredientLabel (SUM(?gPerL) as ?totalGPerL) (COUNT(?gPerL) as ?occurrences)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/mediadive>\nWHERE {\n  ?composition a schema:MediumComposition ;\n               schema:partOfMedium <https://purl.dsmz.de/mediadive/medium/381> ;\n               schema:containsIngredient ?ingredient ;\n               schema:gramsPerLiter ?gPerL .\n  ?ingredient rdfs:label ?ingredientLabel .\n}\nGROUP BY ?ingredientLabel\nORDER BY DESC(?totalGPerL)""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT ?ingredientLabel ?gPerL (COUNT(?gPerL) as ?frequency)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/mediadive>\nWHERE {\n  ?composition a schema:MediumComposition ;\n               schema:partOfMedium <https://purl.dsmz.de/mediadive/medium/381> ;\n               schema:containsIngredient ?ingredient ;\n               schema:gramsPerLiter ?gPerL .\n  ?ingredient rdfs:label ?ingredientLabel .\n}\nGROUP BY ?ingredientLabel ?gPerL\nORDER BY ?ingredientLabel DESC(?frequency)""}}]",CRITICAL,"Tryptone (10 g/L), Yeast extract (5 g/L), NaCl (10 g/L)",Database: MediaDive.

72,2026-01-13,Structured Query,Which countries have the most ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates in AMR Portal?,True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have access to real-time data from the AMR Portal (Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System - GLASS) or any other live database. The AMR Portal data is regularly updated and changes over time as countries submit new surveillance data.

To find which countries have the most ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates in the AMR Portal, you would need to:

1. Visit the WHO AMR Portal directly at https://amr.who.int/
2. Navigate to the dashboard or data exploration tools
3. Filter for:
   - Pathogen: *E. coli*
   - Antibiotic: Ciprofloxacin
   - Then sort by countries with highest resistance rates or number of isolates

From my training knowledge, I know that ciprofloxacin resistance in *E. coli* has been a growing concern globally, with generally higher rates reported in:
- Many Asian countries
- Some African countries
- Parts of Southern and Eastern Europe
- Some Latin American countries

However, the specific rankings and current data would need to be accessed directly from the AMR Portal for accurate, up-to-date information.",,7.44037389755249,61,266,True,True,0.625,"Based on the AMR Portal data, here are the **countries with the most ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates**:

## Top 20 Countries (by number of resistant isolates):

1. **United States of America** (Americas) - 1,041 isolates
2. **United Kingdom** (Europe) - 790 isolates
3. **Norway** (Europe) - 313 isolates
4. **Viet Nam** (Asia) - 101 isolates
5. **Thailand** (Asia) - 91 isolates
6. **Pakistan** (Asia) - 83 isolates
7. **Germany** (Europe) - 79 isolates
8. **Mexico** (Americas) - 45 isolates
9. **India** (Asia) - 44 isolates
10. **Italy** (Europe) - 32 isolates
11. **Bangladesh** (Asia) - 27 isolates
12. **Brazil** (Americas) - 17 isolates
13. **Tanzania** (Africa) - 15 isolates
14. **Guadeloupe** (Americas) - 14 isolates
15. **Rwanda** (Africa) - 11 isolates

18. **Singapore** (Asia) - 4 isolates
19. **Portugal** (Europe) - 3 isolates
20. **Canada** (Americas) - 3 isolates

### Key Findings:
- **The United States dominates** with more than 1,000 ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates
- **Europe represents a significant proportion**, with the UK, Norway, and Germany being major contributors
- **Asian countries** like Viet Nam, Thailand, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh also show substantial numbers
- The data reflects both the actual prevalence of resistance and the intensity of surveillance/sampling in different countries
