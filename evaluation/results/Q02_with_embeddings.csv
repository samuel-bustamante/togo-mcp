13,2025-12-19,Precision,What is the highest resolution ever achieved for a structure in the PDB?,True,False,False,0.0,"Based on my training knowledge, the highest resolution structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) typically achieve resolutions around 0.5-0.6 Angstroms. These ultra-high resolution structures are usually small proteins or peptides with very well-ordered crystal forms.

Some examples of extremely high-resolution structures include certain small proteins like crambin and some engineered peptides that have achieved resolutions in the 0.5-0.6 Å range. However, I don't have access to real-time PDB statistics to tell you the absolute highest resolution structure currently deposited.

It's worth noting that achieving such high resolutions requires exceptional crystal quality, very intense X-ray sources (often synchrotron radiation), and proteins that are inherently well-ordered. The vast majority of protein structures are solved at much more typical resolutions of 1.5-3.0 Å.

If you need the most current record for the highest resolution PDB structure, I'd recommend checking the PDB website directly or using their search tools to sort structures by resolution.",,7.226408004760742,52,234,True,True,1.0,"Based on my search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB), **the highest resolution ever achieved for a structure in the PDB is 0.48 Å (angstroms)**, which is shared by two structures:

1. **PDB ID: 5D8V** - ""Ultra-high resolution structure of high-potential iron-sulfur protein"" with an R-work of 0.072
2. **PDB ID: 3NIR** - ""Crystal structure of small protein crambin at 0.48 A resolution"" with an R-work of 0.127

Both structures were determined using X-ray crystallography and represent truly exceptional atomic resolution. At 0.48 Å resolution, individual atoms can be clearly resolved, and even electron density features like hydrogen atoms may be visible in some cases.

The next highest resolution structures in the PDB are:
- **1EJG** at 0.54 Å (crambin)
- **3P4J** at 0.55 Å (Z-DNA)
- **5NW3** at 0.59 Å (perdeuterated rubredoxin)

It's worth noting that achieving such ultra-high resolution requires exceptional crystal quality, optimized data collection conditions (often including cryocooling), and typically small, well-ordered proteins or nucleic acids.

19,2025-12-19,Currency,What Reactome pathways involve mTOR signaling?,True,True,True,0.5714285714285714,"Based on my training knowledge, several Reactome pathways involve mTOR signaling. Here are the key ones:

## Primary mTOR Pathways:
- **mTOR signalling** - The main pathway covering mTOR complex formation and regulation
- **mTORC1-mediated signalling** - Focusing specifically on mTORC1 complex activities
- **S6K1-mediated signalling** - Downstream effector pathway of mTORC1

## Related/Interconnected Pathways:
- **PI3K/AKT signalling pathway** - Upstream regulator of mTOR
- **Insulin receptor signalling cascade** - Activates mTOR through PI3K/AKT
- **IGF1R signalling cascade** - Another growth factor pathway that activates mTOR
- **AMPK inhibits mTOR signalling** - Energy sensing pathway that negatively regulates mTOR
- **TSC-mediated regulation of mTOR signalling** - Tuberous sclerosis complex regulation of mTOR
- **Amino acid transport across the plasma membrane** - Links amino acid availability to mTOR activation
- **Regulation of mRNA stability by proteins that bind AU-rich elements** - Some mTOR targets involve mRNA stability

These pathways capture mTOR's central role in integrating growth signals, nutrient availability, and energy status to control cell growth, protein synthesis, autophagy, and metabolism.

However, I should note that Reactome is regularly updated, so there may be additional or renamed pathways that I'm not aware of from my training data.",,9.355612993240356,50,370,True,True,0.5714285714285714,"Based on my search through the Reactome database, here are the main Reactome pathways that involve mTOR signaling:

## Core mTOR Signaling Pathways:

### 1. **MTOR signalling**
- This is the main umbrella pathway for mTOR signaling
- Target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly-conserved serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth and division in response to energy levels, growth signals, and nutrients
- mTOR exists as two structurally distinct complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2
- mTORC1 couples energy and nutrient abundance to cell growth and proliferation by balancing anabolic and catabolic processes

### 2. **mTORC1-mediated signalling**
- mTORC1 integrates four major signals: growth factors, energy status, oxygen, and amino acids
- Regulates translation, lipid synthesis, autophagy, and cell growth
- Growth factors stimulate mTORC1 through canonical insulin and Ras signaling pathways
- Energy status is signaled through AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)
- Amino acids positively regulate mTORC1 through Rag proteins and lysosomal membrane recruitment

### 3. **Amino acids regulate mTORC1**
- Amino acids regulate recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane through multiple mechanisms:
  - Sestrin1/2 binds leucine, releasing GATOR2 complex to activate mTORC1
  - CASTOR1 binds arginine, also releasing GATOR2
  - BMT2 (SAMTOR) binds S-adenosylmethionine, dissociating from GATOR1
  - SLC38A9 transporter binds arginine and acts as a GEF for Rag GTPases

### 4. **Energy dependent regulation of mTOR by LKB1-AMPK**
- LKB1 phosphorylates and activates AMPK when cellular AMP:ATP ratio rises
- AMPK activates the TSC complex by phosphorylating TSC2
- Active TSC activates Rheb's intrinsic GTPase activity, resulting in GDP-loaded Rheb and mTOR pathway inhibition

## Related Pathways Involving mTOR:

### 5. **PI3K/AKT Signaling in Cancer**
- PI3K/AKT pathway frequently feeds into mTORC1 activation
- AKT phosphorylates and inactivates TSC2, leading to mTORC1 activation

### 6. **Macroautophagy**
- mTOR negatively regulates autophagy
- Inactivation of mTOR in response to starvation is partly mediated by AMPK activation

### 7. **Activated NTRK2 signals through PI3K**
- NTRK2 (TRKB) activates PI3K, leading to AKT signaling and subsequent mTOR activation

### 8. **Cellular response to starvation**
- mTORC1 complex acts as an integrator regulating translation, lipid synthesis, autophagy, and cell growth in response to glucose, oxygen, amino acids, and growth factors

### 9. **Signaling by Erythropoietin**
- EPO activates PI3K-AKT pathway, which can lead to mTOR signaling activation

### 10. **Signaling by Leptin**
- Leptin signaling includes activation of the mTOR/S6K pathway through various mechanisms

These pathways demonstrate that mTOR signaling is a central hub in cellular metabolism, integrating multiple inputs (nutrients, energy, growth factors) to control cell growth, protein synthesis, autophagy, and metabolic processes. The pathways show mTOR's critical role in both normal physiology and disease states, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurological conditions.",,57.152992963790894,26,2592,34158,265986,"mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX biopax: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathway ?pathwayName ?description\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway rdf:type biopax:Pathway .\n  ?pathway biopax:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  OPTIONAL { ?pathway biopax:comment ?description }\n  \n  FILTER(\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""mtor\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?description)), \""mtor\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""mechanistic target of rapamycin\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?description)), \""mechanistic target of rapamycin\"")\n  )\n}\nORDER BY ?pathwayName""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX biopax: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathwayName\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway rdf:type biopax:Pathway .\n  ?pathway biopax:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  \n  FILTER(\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""mtor\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""mechanistic target of rapamycin\"")\n  )\n}\nORDER BY ?pathwayName""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX biopax: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathwayName ?description\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway rdf:type biopax:Pathway .\n  ?pathway biopax:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  OPTIONAL { ?pathway biopax:comment ?description }\n  \n  VALUES ?pathwayName {\n    \""MTOR signalling\""\n    \""mTORC1-mediated signalling\"" \n    \""Amino acids regulate mTORC1\""\n    \""Energy dependent regulation of mTOR by LKB1-AMPK\""\n  }\n}\nORDER BY ?pathwayName""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX biopax: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?pathway ?pathwayName ?component\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway rdf:type biopax:Pathway .\n  ?pathway biopax:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  ?pathway biopax:pathwayComponent ?component .\n  \n  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""mtor\""))\n}\nLIMIT 20""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX biopax: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathwayName\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway rdf:type biopax:Pathway .\n  ?pathway biopax:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  ?pathway biopax:comment ?description .\n  \n  FILTER(\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?description)), \""mtor\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?description)), \""mechanistic target of rapamycin\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""autophagy\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""pi3k\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""akt\"") ||\n    CONTAINS(LCASE(str(?pathwayName)), \""insulin\"")\n  )\n}\nORDER BY ?pathwayName\nLIMIT 15""}}]",VALUABLE,Multiple MTOR signalling pathway instances across species,Database: Reactome.

However, I can share some general knowledge about molecular weight ranges for FDA-approved drugs based on historical analyses:

**Typical molecular weight ranges:**
- Small molecule drugs: Generally 150-800 Da, with most falling between 200-600 Da
- The ""Rule of Five"" suggests oral drugs typically have molecular weights ≤500 Da
- Some specialized drugs (like certain antibiotics or complex natural products) can exceed 1000 Da
- Biologics (proteins, antibodies) have much higher molecular weights (thousands to hundreds of thousands of Da)

**Historical trends:**
- There has been a gradual increase in average molecular weight of approved drugs over time
- Early drugs were often simpler, smaller molecules
- Modern drugs sometimes target more complex biological pathways requiring larger, more complex structures

For the most current and precise molecular weight distribution data for FDA-approved drugs in PubChem, you would need to query the PubChem database directly or consult recent pharmaceutical literature that has analyzed this specific dataset.",,7.546654939651489,54,257,True,True,0.5,"Based on my analysis of the PubChem database for FDA-approved drugs, here are the key findings about molecular weight ranges:

## Molecular Weight Range of FDA-approved Drugs in PubChem

**Overall Statistics:**
- **Total FDA-approved drugs analyzed:** 17,346 compounds
- **Minimum molecular weight:** 1.008 Da (hydrogen)
- **Maximum molecular weight:** 7,601 Da (large biologics/proteins)  
- **Average molecular weight:** 507.4 Da

**Key Observations:**

1. **Extremely Wide Range:** The molecular weight spans from simple atoms/molecules like hydrogen (1.008 Da) to complex biologics over 7,000 Da.

2. **Small Molecules at the Low End:**
   - Very small drugs include hydrogen (1.008 Da), deuterium (2.016 Da), helium (4.0026 Da)
   - These likely represent medical gases or radiopharmaceuticals
   - Traditional small molecules typically start around 150-200 Da

3. **Large Biologics at the High End:**
   - The highest molecular weight drugs (6,000-7,600 Da) are likely:
     - Large peptides
     - Small proteins
     - Complex biologics
     - Monoclonal antibody fragments

4. **Traditional Drug-Like Range:**
   - Most conventional pharmaceutical drugs fall in the 150-1,000 Da range
   - This aligns with Lipinski's ""Rule of Five"" which suggests molecular weights under 500 Da for good oral bioavailability

5. **Distribution Characteristics:**
   - The average of 507 Da suggests many drugs are in the traditional small-molecule range
   - The wide standard deviation indicates significant diversity in drug sizes
   - Modern drug development increasingly includes larger biologics

This data reflects the evolution of pharmaceutical development from traditional small molecules to include a growing number of biologics, peptides, and other macromolecular therapeutics approved by the FDA.",,55.38047170639038,36,2216,15646,207809,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pubchem""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pubchem"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX vocab: <http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/vocabulary#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\nPREFIX sio: <http://semanticscience.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT (MIN(?weight) as ?min_weight) (MAX(?weight) as ?max_weight) (AVG(?weight) as ?avg_weight) (COUNT(?compound) as ?drug_count)\nWHERE {\n  ?compound a vocab:Compound ;\n            obo:RO_0000087 vocab:FDAApprovedDrugs ;\n            sio:SIO_000008 ?weightDesc .\n  ?weightDesc a sio:CHEMINF_000334 ;\n              sio:SIO_000300 ?weight .\n  FILTER(isNumeric(?weight))\n}""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pubchem"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX vocab: <http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/vocabulary#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\nPREFIX sio: <http://semanticscience.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT \n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN ?weight < 100 THEN 1 END) as ?under_100)\n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN ?weight >= 100 AND ?weight < 200 THEN 1 END) as ?weight_100_200)\n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN ?weight >= 200 AND ?weight < 300 THEN 1 END) as ?weight_200_300)\n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN ?weight >= 300 AND ?weight < 400 THEN 1 END) as ?weight_300_400)\n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN ?weight >= 400 AND ?weight < 500 THEN 1 END) as ?weight_400_500)\n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN ?weight >= 500 AND ?weight < 1000 THEN 1 END) as ?weight_500_1000)\n  (COUNT(CASE WHEN ?weight >= 1000 THEN 1 END) as ?over_1000)\nWHERE {\n  ?compound a vocab:Compound ;\n            obo:RO_0000087 vocab:FDAApprovedDrugs ;\n            sio:SIO_000008 ?weightDesc .\n  ?weightDesc a sio:CHEMINF_000334 ;\n              sio:SIO_000300 ?weight .\n  FILTER(isNumeric(?weight))\n}""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pubchem"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX vocab: <http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/vocabulary#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\nPREFIX sio: <http://semanticscience.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT ?compound ?weight\nWHERE {\n  ?compound a vocab:Compound ;\n            obo:RO_0000087 vocab:FDAApprovedDrugs ;\n            sio:SIO_000008 ?weightDesc .\n  ?weightDesc a sio:CHEMINF_000334 ;\n              sio:SIO_000300 ?weight .\n  FILTER(isNumeric(?weight))\n}\nORDER BY ?weight\nLIMIT 100""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pubchem"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX vocab: <http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/vocabulary#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\nPREFIX sio: <http://semanticscience.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT ?compound ?weight\nWHERE {\n  ?compound a vocab:Compound ;\n            obo:RO_0000087 vocab:FDAApprovedDrugs ;\n            sio:SIO_000008 ?weightDesc .\n  ?weightDesc a sio:CHEMINF_000334 ;\n              sio:SIO_000300 ?weight .\n  FILTER(isNumeric(?weight))\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?weight)\nLIMIT 50""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pubchem"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX vocab: <http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/vocabulary#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\nPREFIX sio: <http://semanticscience.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT ?compound ?weight\nWHERE {\n  ?compound a vocab:Compound ;\n            obo:RO_0000087 vocab:FDAApprovedDrugs ;\n            sio:SIO_000008 ?weightDesc .\n  ?weightDesc a sio:CHEMINF_000334 ;\n              sio:SIO_000300 ?weight .\n  FILTER(isNumeric(?weight) && ?weight >= 150 && ?weight <= 1000)\n}\nORDER BY ?weight\nLIMIT 50""}}]",CRITICAL,"Typical range 150-800 Da, with specific examples at various weights",Database: PubChem.

Here are the main categories of these reactions:

## Transport Reactions
- **ATP/ADP exchange**: `ADP(in) + ATP(out) = ADP(out) + ATP(in)` - ATP/ADP translocator reactions across membranes
- **ATP-driven transport**: Various transport reactions that use ATP hydrolysis to drive substrate movement across membranes

## Kinase Reactions (Phosphorylation)
These are the most common type, where ATP provides phosphate groups:

**Nucleotide kinases:**
- `ATP + GMP = ADP + GDP` (guanylate kinase activity)
- `ATP + UMP = ADP + UDP` (UMP kinase)
- `ATP + dAMP = ADP + dADP` (deoxynucleoside kinases)
- `ATP + dTDP = ADP + dTTP` (nucleoside diphosphate kinases)

**Sugar kinases:**
- `ATP + glycerol = ADP + H(+) + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate` (glycerol kinase)
- `ATP + xylitol = ADP + H(+) + xylitol 5-phosphate` (xylulokinase)
- `ATP + D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate = ADP + D-sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate + H(+)` (sedoheptulokinase)

**Amino acid and metabolite kinases:**
- `ATP + L-arginine = ADP + H(+) + N(ω)-phospho-L-arginine` (arginine kinase)
- `ATP + L-glutamate + NH4(+) = ADP + H(+) + L-glutamine + phosphate` (glutamine synthetase)

## Ligases (ATP-dependent synthesis reactions)
- `ATP + hydrogencarbonate + NH4(+) = ADP + carbamoyl phosphate + H(+) + H2O` (carbamoyl-phosphate synthase)
- `ATP + carbamate = ADP + carbamoyl phosphate` (carbamate kinase)

## Phosphotransferase Reactions
- `ATP + phosphate = ADP + diphosphate` (polyphosphate kinase)
- `ATP + diphosphate = ADP + H(+) + triphosphate` (tripolyphosphate synthase)

## Nucleotidyltransferase Reactions
- `ADP + ATP = adenosine 3'-diphosphate,5'-diphosphate + AMP` (bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphatase)
- `ADP + ATP = adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate + AMP` (dinucleoside tetraphosphate synthetase)

## Antibiotic/Drug Phosphorylation
- `ATP + streptomycin = ADP + H(+) + streptomycin 6-phosphate` (streptomycin kinase)

To find this information, you would typically:

1. **Search UniProt** (uniprot.org) with these parameters:
   - Organism: Homo sapiens (human)
   - Protein name contains: ""kinase""
   - Review status: Reviewed (Swiss-Prot)
   - Has 3D structure: Yes

2. **Common human kinases with known PDB structures include:**
   - **Protein kinase A** (PKA catalytic subunit) - UniProt: P17612
   - **Cyclin-dependent kinase 2** (CDK2) - UniProt: P24941
   - **Epidermal growth factor receptor** (EGFR) - UniProt: P00533
   - **c-Src tyrosine kinase** - UniProt: P12931
   - **Insulin receptor** - UniProt: P06213
   - **Aurora kinase A** - UniProt: O14965
   - **Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta** (GSK3B) - UniProt: P49841
   - **Casein kinase 2** subunits - UniProt: P68400, P19784

3. **The search would typically yield several hundred entries**, as kinases are one of the most structurally characterized protein families.

For the most current and complete list, I recommend directly querying the UniProt database with the search parameters mentioned above, as the database is continuously updated with new structures and annotations.

Would you like me to explain how to perform this search in more detail, or would you prefer information about specific kinase families?",,10.610565185546877,60,421,True,True,0.875,"Perfect!
