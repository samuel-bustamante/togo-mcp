### **Summary Statistics:**

- **Total unique species:** ~100+ species identified
- **Temperature range:** 80-112°C
- **Domains represented:**
  - **Archaea** (majority): Pyrococcus, Methanopyrus, Archaeoglobus, Thermococcus, etc.
  - **Bacteria** (fewer): Aquifex, Thermotoga, Caldicellulosiruptor, Fervidobacterium

### **Notable Features:**

1. **Most extreme:** *Pyrococcus kukulkanii* at 112°C
2. **Most diverse genus:** Thermococcus with 25+ thermophilic species
3. **Geographic origins:** These strains are typically isolated from:
   - Deep-sea hydrothermal vents
   - Terrestrial hot springs
   - Submarine volcanic environments

These hyperthermophiles are primarily **Archaea** from the phyla Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, with some bacterial representatives from Aquificae and Thermotogae.",,49.20167803764343,21,1878,24793,135115,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""bacdive""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""bacdive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?strain ?strainLabel ?genus ?species ?tempStart ?tempEnd\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/bacdive>\nWHERE {\n  ?strain a schema:Strain ;\n          rdfs:label ?strainLabel ;\n          schema:hasGenus ?genus ;\n          schema:hasSpecies ?species .\n  \n  ?temp a schema:CultureTemperature ;\n        schema:describesStrain ?strain ;\n        schema:hasTemperatureRangeStart ?tempStart ;\n        schema:hasTemperatureRangeEnd ?tempEnd .\n  \n  FILTER(?tempStart > 80 || ?tempEnd > 80)\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?tempEnd)\nLIMIT 500""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""bacdive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?genus ?species (MAX(?tempEnd) as ?maxTemp) (COUNT(DISTINCT ?strain) as ?strainCount)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/bacdive>\nWHERE {\n  ?strain a schema:Strain ;\n          schema:hasGenus ?genus ;\n          schema:hasSpecies ?species .\n  \n  ?temp a schema:CultureTemperature ;\n        schema:describesStrain ?strain ;\n        schema:hasTemperatureRangeEnd ?tempEnd .\n  \n  FILTER(?tempEnd > 80)\n}\nGROUP BY ?genus ?species\nORDER BY DESC(?maxTemp) ?genus ?species\nLIMIT 100""}}]",CRITICAL,221 strains,Database: BacDive.
