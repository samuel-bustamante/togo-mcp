1. The Gene Ontology is divided into three main categories (aspects):
   - Molecular Function (MF)
   - Biological Process (BP)
   - Cellular Component (CC)

2. Historically, Molecular Function has been the smallest of the three branches, typically containing several thousand terms (often in the range of 11,000-13,000 terms in recent years).

3. Biological Process is usually the largest branch, followed by Cellular Component, with Molecular Function being the smallest.

The ampicillin resistance rates in E. coli isolates vary by:

1. **Geographic location** - Different countries and regions show different resistance patterns
2. **Time period** - Resistance rates change over time
3. **Source of isolates** - Clinical samples vs. community vs. food/animal sources
4. **Patient population** - Hospital vs. community-acquired infections

To find current ampicillin resistance rates in E. coli from the AMR Portal, you would need to:
- Visit the WHO AMR Portal or your country's specific AMR surveillance portal
- Select E. coli as the organism
- Select ampicillin as the antibiotic
- Choose your region and time period of interest

Generally speaking, ampicillin resistance in E. coli has been historically high in many regions (often 40-60% or higher in some areas), but I cannot provide you with the specific current rate from the AMR Portal without access to that database.

Would you like general information about ampicillin resistance mechanisms in E. coli, or do you have access to the portal and need help interpreting specific data?",,6.928027868270874,58,280,True,True,0.6666666666666666,"Based on the AMR Portal data, here are the ampicillin resistance statistics for **Escherichia coli**:

## Overall Resistance Rate

Out of **15,663 total isolates** tested for ampicillin:
- **Resistant**: 7,688 isolates (49.1%)
- **Susceptible**: 7,942 isolates (50.7%)
- **Intermediate**: 33 isolates (0.2%)

**The overall ampicillin resistance rate in E. coli is approximately 49.1%**
