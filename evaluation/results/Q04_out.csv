   - Reduced permeability

However, I should note that the specific categorization scheme and exact phenotype categories in AMR Portal may have been updated or refined since my training data. The portal's actual implementation might organize phenotypes differently or include additional categories. For the most current and accurate information about the specific resistance phenotype categories available in AMR Portal, I'd recommend checking the portal's documentation or browsing the interface directly.",,7.871760845184326,48,304,True,True,1.0,"Based on my query of the AMR Portal database, there are **5 resistance phenotype categories**:

1. **susceptible** - 1,040,897 measurements (60.7%)
   - The organism is killed or inhibited by the antibiotic at standard concentrations

2. **resistant** - 302,729 measurements (17.7%)
   - The organism is not inhibited by the antibiotic at clinically achievable concentrations

3. **intermediate** - 35,332 measurements (2.1%)
   - The organism shows reduced susceptibility; treatment may be effective with higher doses or at sites where the drug concentrates

4. **non-susceptible** - 828 measurements (0.05%)
   - A broader category indicating the organism is not susceptible (combines resistant and intermediate)

5. **susceptible-dose dependent** - 213 measurements (0.01%)
   - The organism can be treated successfully if higher doses of the antibiotic are used

These categories follow standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) interpretive criteria, primarily based on CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) and EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) guidelines. The AMR Portal contains over 1.7 million phenotypic measurements total, with the majority classified as susceptible, reflecting that most tested organism-antibiotic combinations do not show resistance.",,35.230321168899536,22,872,11493,116770,"mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?phenotype ?label\nWHERE {\n  ?s ?p ?phenotype .\n  ?phenotype rdfs:label ?label .\n  FILTER(CONTAINS(STR(?phenotype), \""phenotype\"") || CONTAINS(STR(?label), \""resistance\"") || CONTAINS(STR(?label), \""phenotype\""))\n}\nLIMIT 100\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""amrportal"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX amr: <http://example.org/ebiamr#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?resistancePhenotype (COUNT(*) as ?count)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/amrportal>\nWHERE {\n  ?s a amr:PhenotypeMeasurement .\n  ?s amr:resistancePhenotype ?resistancePhenotype .\n}\nGROUP BY ?resistancePhenotype\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n""}}]",CRITICAL,"resistant, susceptible, intermediate, non-susceptible, susceptible-dose dependent",Database: AMR Portal.
