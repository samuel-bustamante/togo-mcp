95,2026-01-13,Structured Query,What percentage of ChEBI entities have molecular formulas?,True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have access to current statistics about what percentage of ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) entities have molecular formulas in my training data.

However, I can provide some context: ChEBI is a database of molecular entities focused on small chemical compounds. In principle, most well-characterized chemical entities in ChEBI should have molecular formulas, as this is one of the most basic pieces of information for a chemical compound. 

That said, ChEBI also includes:
- Some generic or class-level entries (like ""alcohol"" or ""amino acid"") that wouldn't have specific molecular formulas
- Incompletely characterized natural products
- Polymers or macromolecules where molecular formulas may be less applicable
- Entities still being curated

My understanding is that the vast majority of specific chemical entities in ChEBI do have molecular formulas, likely well over 90%, but I cannot give you an exact percentage without access to current ChEBI database statistics.",,5.565516948699951,49,216,True,False,0.3333333333333333,"Excellent!

- **Total ChEBI entities:** 223,078

- **Percentage with formulas:** **86.4%**

This means that approximately **86.4%** of ChEBI entities have molecular formulas defined. 

The remaining ~13.6% without molecular formulas likely include:
- Abstract chemical classes (e.g., ""alcohol"", ""steroid"")
- Chemical groups and roles
- Very large macromolecules or complexes that may not have well-defined formulas
- Deprecated or incomplete entries
- Polymers with variable composition
