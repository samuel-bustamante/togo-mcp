108,2026-01-13,Structured Query,Find MediaDive ingredients that have both ChEBI and KEGG cross-references.,True,False,False,0.0,"I don't have access to specific information about MediaDive ingredients or their database cross-references in my training data. MediaDive appears to be a specialized database or resource that I'm not familiar with.

To find ingredients with both ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) cross-references, you would typically need to:

1. Access the MediaDive database directly
2. Query for ingredients that have entries in both the ChEBI and KEGG databases
3. Look for cross-reference fields or identifiers that link to both databases

If you have access to MediaDive, you might want to:
- Check their API or query interface for filtering by cross-references
- Look at their documentation for how cross-references are structured
- Export their data and filter for entries containing both types of identifiers

I apologize that I cannot provide the specific list of MediaDive ingredients with these cross-references without access to that database.",,5.661902189254761,56,221,True,False,0.4,"Perfect! I've successfully retrieved all 283 MediaDive ingredients that have both ChEBI and KEGG cross-references. Let me provide you with a summary of the findings:

## Summary

I found **283 MediaDive ingredients** that have both ChEBI and KEGG cross-references. These ingredients represent a well-annotated subset of the MediaDive database (which contains 1,489 total ingredients), covering:

- **Common sugars**: Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Lactose, Sucrose, Galactose, Cellobiose
- **Amino acids**: All standard amino acids (L-Alanine, L-Arginine, L-Cysteine, L-Glutamine, etc.)
- **Vitamins**: Biotin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Thiamin, Folic acid, Vitamin B12, Vitamin K1
- **Organic acids**: Acetic acid, Butyric acid, Citric acid, Lactic acid, Pyruvic acid, Succinic acid
- **Inorganic salts**: CaCl₂, MgSO₄, K₂HPO₄, Na₂HPO₄, NaCl, various sulfates and chlorides
- **Cofactors**: Coenzyme A, FAD, NAD, Coenzyme M
- **Antibiotics**: Ampicillin, Kanamycin, Penicillin, Rifampicin, Amphotericin B
- **Other compounds**: Agar, Tris buffer, DTT, Resazurin, Hemin, Tween 80

Each ingredient includes:
- **ChEBI ID**: Chemical Entities of Biological Interest identifier
- **KEGG ID**: KEGG Compound identifier
- **Additional data**: PubChem ID (where available), CAS number, chemical formula

This cross-referenced set is particularly valuable for:
- Metabolic pathway analysis (via KEGG)
- Chemical ontology mapping (via ChEBI)
- Integration with other biological databases
- Standardized identification of culture media components

Would you like me to provide more specific information about any particular subset of these ingredients or perform additional analysis?",,43.19169282913208,26,1490,30172,162709,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT ?ingredient ?label ?chebi ?kegg ?pubchem ?cas ?formula\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/mediadive>\nWHERE {\n  ?ingredient a schema:Ingredient ;\n              rdfs:label ?label .\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasChEBI ?chebi }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasKEGG ?kegg }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasPubChem ?pubchem }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasCAS ?cas }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasFormula ?formula }\n  FILTER(BOUND(?chebi) && BOUND(?kegg))\n}\nORDER BY ?label\nLIMIT 100""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(?ingredient) as ?count)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/mediadive>\nWHERE {\n  ?ingredient a schema:Ingredient ;\n              rdfs:label ?label .\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasChEBI ?chebi }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasKEGG ?kegg }\n  FILTER(BOUND(?chebi) && BOUND(?kegg))\n}""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""mediadive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT ?ingredient ?label ?chebi ?kegg ?pubchem ?cas ?formula\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/mediadive>\nWHERE {\n  ?ingredient a schema:Ingredient ;\n              rdfs:label ?label .\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasChEBI ?chebi }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasKEGG ?kegg }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasPubChem ?pubchem }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasCAS ?cas }\n  OPTIONAL { ?ingredient schema:hasFormula ?formula }\n  FILTER(BOUND(?chebi) && BOUND(?kegg))\n}\nORDER BY ?label\nLIMIT 300""}}]",CRITICAL,"Glucose (ChEBI:17234, KEGG:C00031), Agar (ChEBI:2509, KEGG:C08815), Acetic acid (ChEBI:15366, KEGG:C00033)",Database: MediaDive.
