**Top Kinase Targets with Most Potent Inhibitors:**

1. **Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1** - 2,341 unique molecules with IC50 < 10 nM
2. **MAP kinase ERK2** - 1,714 molecules
3. **Tyrosine-protein kinase BTK** - 1,588 molecules
4. **Serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf** - 1,551 molecules
5. **Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2** - 1,472 molecules

### Examples of Ultra-Potent Inhibitors:

**Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) Inhibitors:**
- **CHEMBL3666724**: IC50 = 0.000008 nM (8 pM - picomolar!)
- **CHEMBL1968705**: IC50 = 0.00001 nM (10 pM)
- **CHEMBL3666728**: IC50 = 0.00001 nM (10 pM)

**JAK3 Inhibitors:**
- **CHEMBL3665180**: IC50 = 1.155 nM
- **CHEMBL3335691**: IC50 = 1.49 nM
- **CHEMBL3665182**: IC50 = 1.88 nM

**Notable Broad-Spectrum Inhibitor:**
- **STAUROSPORINE (CHEMBL388978)**: IC50 = 2.4 nM against LMTK3
  - This is a well-known pan-kinase inhibitor

**Other Highly Potent Compounds:**
- **CHEMBL334285**: CDK4 inhibitor with IC50 = 7 nM
- **CHEMBL2177161**: GSK-3β inhibitor with IC50 = 4 nM
- **LGH-447 (CHEMBL3651966)**: PIM1/PIM2/PIM3 inhibitor with IC50 = 6-18 nM

### Key Kinase Classes Represented:
- **JAK family kinases** (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2)
- **MAP kinases** (ERK2, p38 alpha)
- **PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway** kinases
- **Cell cycle kinases** (CDKs, Aurora kinases, PLK1)
- **Receptor tyrosine kinases** (BTK, SYK, FLT3, ALK, SRC)
- **Serine/threonine kinases** (PIM family, B-raf, ROCK)

These potent kinase inhibitors are valuable for:
- **Drug discovery** - lead compounds for cancer and inflammatory diseases
- **Chemical probes** - studying kinase biology
- **Precision medicine** - targeted therapies for specific kinase-driven diseases
